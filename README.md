# 🐠 My Fish Tank - Drag and Drop Game

Welcome to **My Fish Tank**, a fun and simple drag-and-drop game I created while learning the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This is my first ever GitHub project and a milestone in my web development learning journey!

## 🎮 About the Project

The idea behind this project was to create a visually playful "fish tank" scene where plants (images) can be dragged and moved around using your mouse or touch input. It was a great exercise to help me understand:

- How to structure a webpage using HTML
- Styling and positioning with CSS
- Implementing drag-and-drop interactivity using JavaScript

This is just the beginning of my journey into web and software development. I plan to keep improving and building more projects like this!

## 🚀 Features

- Custom-designed fish tank layout
- Self made assets
- Plants on both sides of the tank that can be dragged and moved
- Simple animation effects
- Beginner-friendly and lightweight

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (vanilla)**

## 🎨 Custom Assets

All images and assets used in this project were **created by me** as part of the learning experience. I wanted to not only understand the technical side of building a webpage but also explore some basic design work and creative thinking.
The `PHOTOS` folder includes the plant images that I designed to represent underwater plants that can be dragged into the tank. This gave me a better understanding of how assets are used in a real project.
<br> I'm still learning, so the designs are simple — but they are completely original!
